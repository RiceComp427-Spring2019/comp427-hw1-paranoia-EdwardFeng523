## Rational Paranoia
The homework specifications, as well as the corresponding course slide decks,
can be found on the [Comp427 Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/jqifhp864b37ju).
This assignment is due **Thursday, January 17 at 6 p.m.**

You will do this homework by editing the _README.md_ file. It's in
[MarkDown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
and will be rendered to beautiful HTML when you visit your GitHub repo.

## Student Information
Please also edit _README.md_ and replace your instructor's name and NetID with your own:

_Student name_: Edward Feng

_Student NetID_: jf44

Your NetID is typically your initials and a numeric digit. That's
what we need here.

_If you contacted us in advance and we approved a late submission,
please cut-and-paste the text from that email here._

## Problem 1
- Scenario: {Stadium}
- Assumptions:
  - Assume a lot of people are coming to watch the game in this stadium, since
    the team is frequently ranked among the best in the country.
    Also assume that we have a really professional security team with all of the
    necessary equipments available.
    Also assume that we know what team are the fans rooting for when we sell them
    the tickets.
- Assets:
  - The safety of the people watching the game in the stadium. This is definitely
    the most important one since there will be a significant amount of audience
    in the stadium when there's a game.
  - The safety of the players playing in the game. The players are the people who
    generate the profit so we definitely need to make them safe.
  - The facility inside of the stadium. The stadium is a huge and complicated 
    system that has a lot of important facilities which need to be safe.
  - That the game runs smoothly without interruption. The people paid to watch a 
    smooth game and the players trained for playing a smooth game. We need to make
    sure that both groups get what they deserve.
- Threats:
  - Malicious people sneaking into the stadium threating people watching the game.
    There might be malicious people trying to get into the stadium and use dangerous
    items or even weapons to threat other people.
  - Fans for different teams fighting against each other. Fans can be crazy sometimes.
  - Malicious people interrupting the game (cut electricity etc.) There are always
    some people who are trying to interrupt the game. They might cut the water or
    electricity etc.
- Countermeasures:
  - For the first and the third threats, we need to set security check at every
    entrance of the stadium to make sure that nobody brings dangerous stuff into
    the stadium. The cost might be a little high considering we need to get the
    professional equipments for things like scanning and detecting. But the benefit
    is enormous as it can help us avoid so many problems in the stadium.
  - To avoid fans for different teams fighting each other. We can try to put them into
    different sections when we assign them seats, as we assumed that we know who they
    are rooting for. The cost is not that high here and the benefit is decent. But the
    assumption that we made is critical, otherwise we wouldn't know how to separate these
    fans.
  - To avoid people interrupting the game, we need to make sure that we have our security
    people patrolling around the stadium, especially around the critical areas. The cost
    is not that high and it should be enough to address issues that are not so serious.
    Also for threats like power cut, we need to have a backup system in case there's 
    emergency. The cost of this might be really high, but the benefit is also enormous,
    since it guarantees that the game runs smoothly.


## Problem 2
- Scenario: {Grading}
- Assumptions:
  - explain_your_assumptions
- Assets:
  - The integrity of the grades. The grades must remain what they are and cannot be
    modified by anybody. Make sure that only I, along with other graders can change
    the grade.
  - The authenticity and integrity of the homework. Once homework is due, they can't
    change it anymore and the homework must be their authentic work. There shouldn't
    be any plagiarism.
- Threats:
  - System hack. Some students might try to sneak into the system and change their grades.
    In this case the graders are no longer the only people who can edit the grades.
  - Cheating. Some students might keep working on the homework after it is due, this
    would happen especially when the homework is submitted online. Some students might
    copy other students homework entirely, which is plagiarizing.
- Countermeasures:
  - Build a robust online grading system that uses sophisticated authentication system,
   maybe two factor authentication, when we're trying to change the grade, and only the
   graders have access to these special authentications (the two factor authentication app
   can only be installed on the graders' cell phones). The cost might be a little high but
   it is super necessary because having other people messing around with the system definitely
   needs to be avoided.
  - We can keep a time stamp whenver something got edited or submitted. Then when we're grading
    them, we need to double check the time stamp on each submitted homework. For plagiarism, we
    can manually check every single pair of homework, which requires significant amount of human
    work and is probably not worth it. We can also develop or purchase some software to do this,
    it might be costly but can save up a lot of human hours.
